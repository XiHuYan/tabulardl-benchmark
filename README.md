# Deep Learning vs `LightGBM` for tabular data

This repo contains the code to run over $\sim$1300 experiments that compare the
performance of Deep Learning algorithms for tabular data with `LightGBM`.

Deep Learning models for tabular data are run via the [pytorch-widedeep]
(https://github.com/jrzaurin/pytorch-widedeep) library.
